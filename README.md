# OpenGL_Waveguide_stimulation
using Opengl API stimulate the electromagnetic fields distributions.  This is a toy program
I am sorry for not adding any documents explaining my codes. If you are interested in these codes and have any confusion, feal free to contact me. 


I develop this program on MS VS 2012 and use the glfw, glm, glew lib. You can download and distribute them within only 5 mins.  

To compile it correctly, you may need modify the setting file OpenGL.props to change the pathes of the libs mentioned above.
